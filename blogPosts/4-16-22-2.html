                    <p>So far, I have learned a lot more than I was expecting to.  My knowledge of HTML and CSS improves every day.
                        I am now much more comfortable creating structures of content within the website, although horizontal shrinking
                        of the window has been giving me some issues.  It is functional, but also not great.  I have removed the contact
                        and project page since recording the video from earlier today, and now only have home and blog.  Both of these
                        pages are complete now, with basic form and content and usability.
