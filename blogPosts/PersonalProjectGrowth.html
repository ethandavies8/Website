                <p>When it comes to trying to get your first software job, many companies are looking for
                    more than just “I took these courses.” Many expect students to take their own initiative,
                    creating projects of their own which they are able to show off. For me personally,
                    that was a struggle for a while. I often felt too busy with school work to have time
                    to pursue my own personal projects. Working while going to school definitely didn’t
                    help either, as that is even less time you have to do homework or pursue your own
                    passions/projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s not hard to understand why many companies are looking for those who are more
                    ambitious and have created their own projects. Not only does it show initiative outside
                    of courses, and a desire to grow, but it provides potential employers with tangible
                    evidence of your coding ability. Anyone could say they know how to code, but it’s much
                    different to show a project you created from scratch, talking through how you got
                    through each hurdle, and learned as a developer along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somewhere along my own path, I developed very bad imposter syndrome, and
                    doubted my own ability, besides the fact I was doing good in all of my coursework.
                    What helped most with this was finding a desire to pursue my own projects. It was
                    hard to get started, as I doubted I could make anything meaningful or beneficial,
                    but ultimately the point is to grow and learn. I reached the realization that if
                    I wanted to feel more confident in my programming ability (as well as get an internship
                    later) I needed to just work on my own projects, and make something.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Making a program is great for looking back at what you have accomplished,
                    I can go view all my updates and history in GitHub, and see all the progress
                    I have made over time. It doesn’t necessarily have to be something massive.
                    I wanted to challenge myself and learn some web development since it felt very
                    prevalent in local businesses and I felt I was lacking any schooling teaching me
                    web development (so far anyway). So I downloaded vscode, and just started looking
                    up how to do things. How to make a taskbar, how to organize text this way, how to
                    organize text that way, how to make a hyperlink. That on its own was enough that
                    although I may have just been writing html and css, I wanted to do more.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I started messing around in html and css, and then slowly integrating javascript.
                    Working with javascript made me want to build a full web application using javascript,
                    but i’m still very new to javascript, so instead I made the application in C#, which I
                    am familiar with. Thus my 2048 project was born, which is currently at the rough
                    functionality stage. When I finish that project in C#, and after i’ve practiced a
                    bit more with javascript, I will translate the project to javascript.
                    Thus developing a lot of new skills along the way.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In a matter of a few weeks, I have learned a ton about web development, learned to
                    write html and css, and soon to become familiar with javascript. This takes me from
                    having basic experience in java and C# to knowing java, C#, html, css, and javascript,
                    as well as becoming a generally more rounded developer. Not only learning new languages,
                    but also practicing my C# object oriented programming following MVC.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This has helped immensely with my imposter syndrome, and when I had an interview at my
                     University to be a Quality Assurance student intern working with Java, I had the 
                     confidence I needed to promote myself and my work, securing the position.  I had interviews
                      before, but often felt unsure of myself and ill prepared for what was coming.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I can feel myself improving as a programmer constantly, whereas before I felt I was 
                    stuck where I was, and not improving.  I think that is the most important thing that personal
                     projects have to offer.  When you are on your own, making whatever you want to make, there
                      is a freedom found which allows you to just delve deep into whatever you want to make.  
                      For me, that ended up being this website, and my 2048 project.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t want to forget just how beneficial this time has been for me, which is why as I 
                    got better at web development, I decided to make this site.  It started purely 
                    professionally, I would just list projects I made to show off what I was doing, but I
                     wanted it to be more than that.  I wanted to document my progress as I learn and grow,
                      to see how far I have come.  This will be where I can show off my work, talk about my 
                      journey, and eventually I hope to help others along this journey as well.  

                </p>
                <p>
                    I had not ever even seen a line of code until I got to college, and I want to show that 
                    anyone can become a programmer, it’s all about your mentality, and having a drive to better
                     yourself and your abilities.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is my personal project, my ever growing site, with ever growing updates.  
                    I’m sure it will take many shapes and forms over time, in fact it already has, 
                    I have been through probably 5-6 main page styles already.  My personal project 
                    for my own personal growth.  I think there is a lot of value in seeing where others
                     have come from, and when I am successful I want to remember the journey it took to 
                     get me there. I want to show a roadmap of how I got there for anyone who wants to
                      follow along, whether they pursue the same path or something different, the guide 
                      is here if they want it.  Best of luck to myself, and anyone reading.
