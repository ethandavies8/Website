                <p>So far, I have learned a lot more than I was expecting to.  My knowledge of HTML and CSS improves every day.
                    I am now much more comfortable creating structures of content within the website, although horizontal shrinking
                    of the window has been giving me some issues.  It is functional, but also not great.  I have removed the contact
                    and project page since recording the video from earlier today, and now only have home and blog.  Both of these
                    pages are complete now, with basic form and content and usability.

                    <h4>An Updated Webpage! 4/26/2022</h4>
                </a>
                <p>This is a short video demonstrating the current state of the webpage as of 4/26/2022.
                    It is very bare bones and lacks any meaningful content/design, but this is my first time using
                    html and css, so there has to be a starting point. I have figured out basic formatting,
                    html is used to divide into seperate areas and into blocks and chunks. While CSS is used
                    to dress up those chunks.

                    <h4>Getting started with a webpage, 4/21/2022</h4>
                </a>
                <p>This is the very first post I will have made on this site, the purpose
                    of this site is to document my own improvement and knowledge over time.
                    As a part of this process, this web page will be home to all of my open
                    source projects. This website will also be home to articles I may write on various topics.
                    This page may be used professionally, creatively, or in many different ways.
                    It is to be the home of my passions and projects as I improve professionally and personally.
                </p>
